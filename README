# Introduction

A guide to understand Events in Javascript and how they are used in Eventlisteners of the EventTarget Interface.If you are 
not familiar with events in Javascript , an Event interface represents an event ( Don't think hard it's just an action ) that takes place on an EventTarget .The EventTarget interface is implemented by objects that can recieve events and may have listeners for them. An event can be triggered by user action
eg tapping the mouse button or tapping a keyboard. Common targets of the EventTarget are the Element, Document and Window objects.

# DOMContentLoaded

In our case we will be using the DOMContentLoaded event that fires when the Html Document has been completely parsed.It does not wait for other things
like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.
